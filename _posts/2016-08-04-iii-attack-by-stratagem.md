  Master Sun, Sun Tzu, may or may not have been a real person. The Art of War,
  which is attributed to him, may have been a document to which many Chinese
  Philosophers had contributed. Although it has been dated to around 600 BCE, it
  mentions the use of chariots, which were used for a brief period around 400
  BCE in Chinese warfare.
