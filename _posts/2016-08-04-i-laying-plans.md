LAYING PLANS</h1><p>Master Sun, Sun Tzu, may or may not have been a real person. The Art of War, which is attributed to him, may have been a document to which many Chinese Philosophers had contributed. Although it has been dated to around 600 BCE, it mentions the use of chariots, which were used for a brief period around 400 BCE in Chinese warfare.</p></article>

1. _Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State._
2. _It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected._
3. _The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field. These are:_
  1. _The Moral Law;_
  2. _Heaven;_
  3. _Earth;_
  4. _The Commander;_
  5. _Method and discipline._
4. _The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger._
5. _Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons._
6. _Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death._
7. _The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness._
8. _By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure._
9. _These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail._
10. _Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--_
  1. _Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?_
  2. _Which of the two generals has most ability?_
  3. _With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?_
  4. _On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?_
  5. _Which army is stronger?_
  6. _On which side are officers and men more highly trained?_
  7. _In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?__By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat._
11. _The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:--let such a one be dismissed!_
12. _While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules._
13. _According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans._
14. _All warfare is based on deception._
15. _Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near._
16. _Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him._
17. _If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him._
18. _If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant._
19. _If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them._
20. _Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected._
21. _These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand._
22. _Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose._
